A webapp for a group of researchers to conduct surveys. The surveys consist of a list of statements that are rated on a 5-point scale (from "strongly agree" down to "strongly disagree"). The researchers create a survey, and assign a supervisor to it. The supervisor assigns the survey to a group of respondents. The supervisor tracks each respondent's progress. When all respondents have completed the survey, the results can be viewed in a chart.
